.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\s-1SCCS\s0 was the dominant version control system until the release of the
Revision Control System. Today, \s-1SCCS\s0 is generally considered obsolete.
However, its file format is still used internally by a few other revision
control programs, including BitKeeper and TeamWare. Sablime[1] also allows
the use of \s-1SCCS\s0 files. The \s-1SCCS\s0 file format uses a storage technique called
interleaved deltas (or the weave). This storage technique is now considered
by many revision control system developers as key to some advanced merging
techniques, such as the \*(L"Precise Codeville\*(R" (\*(L"pcdv\*(R") merge.
.PP
This interface aims at the possibility to read those files, without the
need of the sccs utility set, and open up to the possibility of scripts
that use it to convert to more modern VCSs like git, Mercurial, \s-1CVS,\s0 or
subversion.
.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.IX Header "FUNCTIONS"
.SS "Meta function"
.IX Subsection "Meta function"
.IP "new (<file>)" 4
.IX Item "new (<file>)"
The constructor only accepts a single argument: the \s-1SCCS\s0 file. this will
typically be something like \f(CW\*(C`SCCS/s.file.c\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If anything in that file makes \f(CW\*(C`new ()\*(C'\fR believe that it is not a \s-1SCCS\s0
file, it will return undef. In this stage, there is no way yet to tell
why \f(CW\*(C`new ()\*(C'\fR failed.
.IP "file" 4
.IX Item "file"
Returns the name of the parsed file. Useful if you have more than a
single \f(CW$sccs\fR object.
.IP "checksum" 4
.IX Item "checksum"
Returns the checksum that was stored in the file. This module does not
check if it is valid, nor does it have functionality to calculate a new
checksum.
.IP "users" 4
.IX Item "users"
Returns the list of users that was recorded in this file as authorized
to make deltas/changes.
.IP "flags" 4
.IX Item "flags"
Returns a hash of the flags set for this file (if set at all). \s-1VCS::SCCS\s0
does not do anything with these flags. They are here for the end-user only.
.Sp
Note that not all flags are supported by all versions of \f(CW\*(C`admin\*(C'\fR, like
\&\f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is supported on HP-UX, but not in \s-1CSSC.\s0
.RS 4
.IP "t <type of program>" 4
.IX Item "t <type of program>"
File has a user defined value for the \f(CW%Y\fR% keyword.
.IP "v [<program name>]" 4
.IX Item "v [<program name>]"
File was flagged to prompt for \s-1MR\s0 (using <program name> for validation).
.IP "i <keyword string>" 4
.IX Item "i <keyword string>"
File was flagged to require id keywords.
.IP "b" 4
.IX Item "b"
File was allowed to pass \-b to get to create branch deltas.
.IP "m <module name>" 4
.IX Item "m <module name>"
File has a user defined value for the \f(CW%M\fR% keyword.
.IP "f <floor>" 4
.IX Item "f <floor>"
File was given a floor: the lowest release, a number from 1 to 9998, which
may be get for editing.
.IP "c <ceiling>" 4
.IX Item "c <ceiling>"
File was given a ceiling: a number less than or equal to 9999, which can
be retrieved by a get command.
.IP "d <default sid>" 4
.IX Item "d <default sid>"
File was given a default delta number \s-1SID.\s0
.IP "n" 4
.IX Item "n"
File created null deltas for skipped major versions.
.IP "j" 4
.IX Item "j"
File was flagged to allow concurrent edits on the same \s-1SID.\s0
.IP "l <lock releases>" 4
.IX Item "l <lock releases>"
File was given a list of releases to which deltas can no longer be made.
.IP "q <user defined text>" 4
.IX Item "q <user defined text>"
File has a user defined value for the \f(CW%Q\fR% keyword.
.IP "s <line count>" 4
.IX Item "s <line count>"
Defines the number of lines scanned for keyword expansion. Past that
line, no keyword expansion takes place. Not implemented in all version.
.Sp
This flag is a \s-1SUN\s0 extension that does not exist in historic \s-1SCCS\s0
implementations and is completely ignored by \f(CW\*(C`VCS::SCCS\*(C'\fR.
.IP "x (HP-UX, \s-1SCO\s0)" 4
.IX Item "x (HP-UX, SCO)"
File was flagged to set execution bit on get. This is the implementation
that \s-1VCS::SCCS\s0 knows about.
.IP "x SCHILY|0 (other)" 4
.IX Item "x SCHILY|0 (other)"
Enable \s-1SCCS\s0 extensions that are not implemented in classical \s-1SCCS\s0
variants. If the \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR flag is enabled, the keywords \f(CW%D\fR%, \f(CW%E\fR%, \f(CW%G\fR%
and \f(CW%H\fR% are expanded even though not explicitly enabled by the \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR
flag.
.Sp
This flag is a \s-1SCHILY\s0 extension that does not exist in historic \s-1SCCS\s0
implementations.
.IP "y <val> ..." 4
.IX Item "y <val> ..."
The list of \s-1SCCS\s0 keywords to be expanded. If the \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR flag is missing,
all keywords are expanded. If the flag is present but the list is empty,
no keyword is expanded and no \*(L"No id keywords\*(R" message is generated. The
value \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR controls the expansion of the \f(CW%sccs\fR.include.filename% keyword.
.Sp
This flag is a \s-1SUN/SCHILY\s0 extension that does not exist in historic \s-1SCCS\s0
implementations.
.Sp
This flag is currently ignored in \f(CW\*(C`VCS::SCCS\*(C'\fR.
.IP "z <reserved for use in interfaces>" 4
.IX Item "z <reserved for use in interfaces>"

.IP "comment" 4
.IX Item "comment"
The comment that was added when the file was created.
.IP "current" 4
.IX Item "current"
In scalar context returns the current revision number. That is the
number of the file that would be restored by get with no arguments.
.Sp
In list context, it returns the current revision, version and parts
of the version, something like \f(CW\*(C`(70, "5.39", 5, 39, undef, undef)\*(C'\fR.
The last 4 numbers are the equivalent of the keywords \f(CW%R\fR%, \f(CW%L\fR%, \f(CW%B\fR%,
and \f(CW%S\fR% for that release.
.IP "set_translate (<type>)" 4
.IX Item "set_translate (<type>)"
By default \s-1VCS::SCCS\s0 will not translate the \s-1SCCS\s0 keywords (like \f(CW\*(C`%W%\*(C'\fR,
see \f(CW\*(C`translate ()\*(C'\fR for the full list). With \f(CW\*(C`set_translate ()\*(C'\fR, you
can select a translation type: \f(CW\*(C`SCCS\*(C'\fR is currently the only supported
type, \f(CW\*(C`CVS\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`RCS\*(C'\fR are planned. Passing a false argument will reset
translation to none.
.Sp
You can also pass a hashref that will do custom translation:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&  my %trans = (
\&    "%W%" => "This is my what id",
\&    "%E%" => "Yesterday",
\&    "%U%" => "Noon",
\&    #...

\&  $sccs\->set_translate (\e%tran);

.Sp
any missing keywords will not be translated.

For now, \f(CW%D\fR%, \f(CW%H\fR%, \f(CW%T\fR%, \f(CW%G\fR%, \f(CW%F\fR%, \f(CW%P\fR%, and \f(CW%C\fR% are not translated.
I see no use for \f(CW%D\fR%, \f(CW%H\fR%, or \f(CW%T\fR%. People that use \f(CW%G\fR% have enough
problems already, so they should be able to cope, \f(CW%F\fR% and \f(CW%P\fR% lose
their meaning after conversion and \f(CW%C\fR% might be done later.

If you convert from \s-1SCCS\s0 to git, it might be advisable to not do
any translation at all, and leave the keywords in, just the way
they are, and create a checkout hook.

\&\s-1SCCS\s0 file format is reasonable well documented. I have included a
manual page for sccsfile for HP-UX in doc/

See the files in examples/ for my attempts to start converters to
other VCSs

.IX Header "BUGS AND LIMITATIONS"
As this module is created as a base for conversion to more useful
and robust VCSs, it is a read-only interface to the \s-1SCCS\s0 files.

Translation is incomplete and might be questionable, but at least
there is a workaround.

https://sourceforge.net/projects/cssc
A \s-1GNU\s0 project that aims to be a drop-in replacement for \s-1SCCS.\s0 It is
written in c++ and therefor disqualifies to be used at any older \s-1OS\s0
that does support \s-1SCCS\s0 but has no \*(C+ compiler. And even if you have
one, there is a good chance it won't build or does not bass the basic
tests. I did not get it to work.
